## Overview
### Description
An app that users can use to opyimize focus by creating tasks and setting a timer to finish task. Users can also listen to music while focusing on task.

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Study / Music
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer. Functionality wouldnâ€™t be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version could potentially have more features.
- **Story:** Allows users to optimize focus and concentration to work on tasks by setting timer, with relaxing music and also setting incentive.
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app.
- **Habit:** Whenever a user starts to work on something, they would hop onto the app and use it for quick and easy music, as well as timers to keep them on track. 
- **Scope:** First we target it to students and then it can evolve into a much larger audience with broader music choices and a developed reward system.
